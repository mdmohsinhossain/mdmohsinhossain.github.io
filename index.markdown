> Hello and welcome! 👋 🙋‍♂️

[Mohsin](https://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=mohsin&voice=Ewa){:target="_blank"} Here.  

I have completed both my bachelor's and master's degrees in [Development Studies at the University of Dhaka](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/DVS){:target="_blank"}, Bangladesh. Currently, I am working as a Research Associate at [BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD)](https://bigd.bracu.ac.bd/staffprofile/md-mohsin-hossain/){:target="_blank"}, BRAC University. Here, I am part of the Environment and Climate Change Cluster.  

Before this role, I was a [Trainee Research Associate](https://archive.ph/SlMAC){:target="_blank"} at BIGD, Brac University, as part of the [Young Researchers' Fellowship program](https://sites.google.com/bracu.ac.bd/bigdyrfp/home){:target="_blank"} in 2022.  

My areas of interest include exploring Public Policy and Politics, Sustainable Rural Livelihoods, the Impact of Climate Change on Livelihood and Poverty, and Migration. Additionally, I am keen on acquiring skills related to fact-checking and promoting digital literacy. 😇
