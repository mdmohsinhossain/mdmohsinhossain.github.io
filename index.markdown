I'm [Mohsin](https://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=mohsin&voice=Ewa){:target="_blank"}, a Research Associate at the [BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD)](https://bigd.bracu.ac.bd/staffprofile/md-mohsin-hossain/){:target="_blank"},BRAC University, working in the Environment and Climate Change Cluster.

I hold both bachelor's and master's degrees in [Development Studies](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/DVS){:target="_blank"}s from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Before this, I was aÂ [Trainee Research Associate](https://archive.ph/SlMAC){:target="_blank"}Â at BIGD, Brac University, as part of theÂ [Young Researchers' Fellowship program](https://sites.google.com/bracu.ac.bd/bigdyrfp/home){:target="_blank"}Â in 2022.

My research interest is on the critical intersection of public policy, sustainable livelihoods, and the impact of climate change. I'm passionate about generating data-driven insights that inform effective solutions to these complex challenges.

Recognizing the growing threat of misinformation in the age of mass information, I'm trying to acquire skills in fact-checking to promote digital literacy. It's crucial to empower individuals to navigate online information effectively, mitigating the risks of scams, fraud, and violence fueled by fake news and rumors.
