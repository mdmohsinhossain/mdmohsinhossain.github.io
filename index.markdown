<a name="top"></a> I am working as a Research Associate at the Environment and Climate Change Cluster of the [BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD)](https://bigd.bracu.ac.bd/staffprofile/md-mohsin-hossain/){:target="_blank"}, BRAC University.

I hold both bachelor's and master's degrees in [Development Studies](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/DVS){:target="_blank"}s from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Before this, I was aÂ [Trainee Research Associate](https://archive.ph/SlMAC){:target="_blank"}Â at BIGD, as part of theÂ [Young Researchers' Fellowship program](https://sites.google.com/bracu.ac.bd/bigdyrfp/home){:target="_blank"}Â in 2022.

My research interest lies in the intersection of public policy, sustainable livelihoods, and climate change adaptation, examining how environmental factors influence social and economic outcomes. I aim to understand the mechanisms by which these factors affect communities and individuals, as well as how they can adapt to new challenges. By exploring these impact channels and mechanisms using both quantitative and qualitative methods, I seek to generate data-driven insights with a holistic perspective to develop effective solutions to these complex challenges.

In my spare time, I try to learn and explore topics related to data analysis, productivity, AI tools, and digital literacy. Recognizing the growing threat of misinformation in the age of mass information, I am also interested in promoting digital literacy as it is crucial to empower individuals (especially those who are not tech-savvy and lack digital literacy) to navigate online information effectively, mitigating the risks of scams, fraud, and violence fueled by fake news and rumors.
