<a name="top"></a> I am working as a Research Associate at the Environment and Climate Change Cluster of the [BRAC Institute of Governance and Development (BIGD)](https://bigd.bracu.ac.bd/staffprofile/md-mohsin-hossain/){:target="_blank"}, BRAC University.

I hold both bachelor's and master's degrees in [Development Studies](https://www.du.ac.bd/body/DVS){:target="_blank"}s from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Before this, I was aÂ [Trainee Research Associate](https://archive.ph/SlMAC){:target="_blank"}Â at BIGD, as part of theÂ [Young Researchers' Fellowship program](https://sites.google.com/bracu.ac.bd/bigdyrfp/home){:target="_blank"}Â in 2022.

My research interest lies at the critical intersection of public policy, sustainable livelihoods, and the impact of climate change. I am passionate about generating data-driven insights using quantitative and qualitative methods to gain holistic insights that inform effective solutions to these complex challenges.

In my spare time, I try to learn and explore things related to fact-checking tools. Recognizing the growing threat of misinformation in the age of mass information, I am also interested in promoting digital literacy as it is crucial to empower individuals (especially those who are not tech-savvy and lack digital literacy) to navigate online information effectively, mitigating the risks of scams, fraud, and violence fueled by fake news and rumors.
